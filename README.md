In (Android) library development, the local development setup differs from how customers integrate the library.

Local development uses a module dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation project(':library')
}
```

Customers integrate through Maven:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation `com.jeroenmols.lib:library:1.0.0`
}
```

Now because both integration mechanisms are fundamentally different, they can also lead to different results.

Wouldnâ€™t it be great if you could test the Maven version of your library directly in your project?

This project shows how this can be done!

Benefits:

- avoids deploying the library to Maven
- more realistic testing
- speeds up release testing
